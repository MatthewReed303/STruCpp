/**
 * STruC++ Runtime — generic parameter descriptor (CODESYS `ANY`).
 *
 * A generic input parameter is not passed by value. The compiler replaces it
 * with the descriptor below and passes the argument by reference, which is why
 * only a variable may be supplied — a literal has no address to take.
 *
 * The layout is CODESYS's, field for field and in order:
 *
 *     TYPE AnyType : STRUCT
 *         typeclass : __SYSTEM.TYPE_CLASS ;
 *         pvalue    : POINTER TO BYTE;
 *         diSize    : DINT;
 *     END_STRUCT END_TYPE
 *
 * The members are spelled upper-case because that is what generated code
 * says: ST identifiers are case-insensitive and the compiler normalises them,
 * so a POU imported from a CODESYS library reading `any.typeclass` resolves to
 * `TYPECLASS` here, and a native block sees its pins in the same case as every
 * other pin it is given.
 *
 * `pvalue` addresses the payload, not the `IECVar<T>` wrapper around it:
 * codegen fills it from `IECVar<T>::raw_ptr()`, which is the runtime's
 * supported route for external readers and the one `force()` keeps up to date.
 * `diSize` is `sizeof(T)` — the logical IEC width, matching `IEC_SIZEOF` and
 * CODESYS's `SIZEOF`, not the wrapper's footprint.
 *
 * Generic parameters are IEC 61131-3 Ed 3 §6.4.3 "beyond the scope of this
 * standard" for user-declared POUs, so this is a CODESYS-compatible extension,
 * declared as one — the same footing as `__XWORD`, `ADR` and `SIZEOF`.
 *
 * A composite is accepted, and the class names the composite: every array is
 * `TYPE_ARRAY` whatever its elements. A block that has to tell an array of
 * bits from an array of words wants a typed `ARRAY [*]` VAR_IN_OUT parameter
 * or a descriptor of its own.

/**
 * `__SYSTEM.TYPE_CLASS` — what `IEC_ANY::typeclass` holds.
 *
 * The values are CODESYS's own and are part of the ABI: imported code compares
 * against them by name, and any renumbering silently changes what a block
 * thinks it was handed. Underlying type is `uint32_t` because CODESYS declares
 * the enumeration over `DWORD`.
 *
 * Unscoped, also to match CODESYS: there an enumeration converts to its base
 * type, so `dwClass := any.typeclass` is ordinary ST. A scoped `enum class`
 * would refuse that assignment and make reading the field awkward for no gain
 * — `TYPE_CLASS::TYPE_INT` still qualifies either way.
 *
 * The whole enumeration is defined even though only the elementary members are
 * reachable from a declarable generic, so that a comparison written against
 * CODESYS documentation resolves rather than failing to compile.
